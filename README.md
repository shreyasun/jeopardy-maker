# MERN Stack Project - Jeopardy Maker
#### By Shreya Sundar

### [Demo Video](https://youtu.be/h5tqkI4YimE)

### Description
As someone who loves trivia and learning random facts, I wanted to create a project that encompasses that interest. I really enjoy watching Jeopardy!, one of the most popular American game shows, which inspired me to create a web application modeled after the Jeopardy question and answer format. I decided to create a Jeopardy Maker, where users can add trivia cards to be generated into an interactive Jeopardy Board. It includes a Firebase login, MongoDB Database, RESTful API calls using axios and a Node-Express Server, and a user interface developed by React.js. 

### Usage
0. Prerequisites: Make sure to have [Node.js](nodejs.org), [Git](git-scm.com), and [MongoDB](mongodb.com) installed onto your machine.
1. Clone the repository using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to frontend directory by `cd frontend` and install dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Run frontend using `npm start`. The application will open on `http://localhost:3000/login`.
4. Navigate out of the frontend directory to backend by `cd ../backend`. 
5. Run backend using `npm start`. You should see a success message on your terminal output, which indicates that the server has connected to the database.
6. Go to `http://localhost:3000/login` and start using the application!

### Resources used:
I did this project with knowledge of Javascript and React. Here are some other resources I used for other parts.
- https://youtu.be/c2M-rlkkT5o: I learned some MongoDB essentials here.
- https://youtu.be/fgTGADljAeg: I learned about REST API's and testing them here.
- https://youtu.be/R81g-2r6ynM: I followed this tutorial to learn how to build a simple full stack application, and a lot of principles from here were applied to this project!
- https://www.makeuseof.com/react-form-data-mongodb-database-store/: I learned how to synchronize React form data with MongoDB.
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZAnibwI9u8&t=3s: Learned how to set up Firebase sign in with Google
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60923933/mern-stack-same-data-appearing-for-all-users: I learned to deal with different user data in MongoDB
- And a bunch of other Google searches, documentations, YouTube videos, and more to get my project to work!

### Future Plans
This project has been an incredible experience for me to learn about the fundamentals of full stack development! However, this is just a taste and there is so much more to learn.

This is my stopping point for now, although if I were to come back to this project in the future, there are several things I would like to change, edit, or do:
- Deploy it online!
- Use a different database, or use MongoDB Atlas on MongoDB Cloud. This would definitely help during deployment.
- Significantly change my UI structure. In hindsight, I realize that I could have created a lot more individual components with props to make my code a lot more cleaner and less repetitive. However while coding I was pretty much putting my ideas down and going with what worked at the moment!
- Continue to identify any more bugs... there's probably still some in there unfortunately

... and more!
